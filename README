The Nu-Hub is the Mind, Body and Soul of Nurun Toronto. Consisting of three separate yet intertwined entities, it is an all-in-one digital destination for Nuruners to connect with one another while staying productive:

Nu-Lunch – A management system for placing group lunch orders. Perfect for project teams or co-workers that like Dim Sum, Nu-Lunch makes it easy to collect payments and order information from all participants.
Nu-Store – An online marketplace, Nu-Store provides a platform for Nuruners to buy, sell, trade and borrow things and skills from one another.
N-24 – The go-to spot for all your Nurun Toronto information. Featuring local and global Nurun events and initiatives, Kudo Cards/Cubies, peer recognition,  neighbourhood news and social media feeds, it makes it easy to stay up to date with everything happening at the office.
